# BasicAlgorithms-Projects

Included are the projects that I did for my basic algorithms course.

1. Implementation of a program that finds the Minimum soanning tree from a graph given the nodes and their weights.
2. Implementation of a program to find the LOngest common subsequence in a string.

Both are implmented in Python.
